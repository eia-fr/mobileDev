			\subsection{M file of the address with the int and numberDouble}	
				\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{./images/srcAddress.png}

			\subsection{Setting value of text fields}	
					\begin{center}
						\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{./images/displayValue.png}
					\end{center}
				At the load of the application we set the value that will be displayed\\
				The conversion form int to string was found on this website: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/169925/how-to-do-string-conversions-in-objective-c
			\subsection{Result after loading}

			\subsection{Registering and receiving the KVO notification in the employee class }
			\begin{center}
						\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{./images/regrec.png}

			\subsection{Result of the execution}
			\begin{center}
						\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./images/result2KVO.png}
			\end{center}
			1 .For this tests , we change at first the street value then press set\\
			2 The we change the number value and press set\\
			3 Finally we change both value and press set\\
			
			We tried to call just the didChangeValueForKey  in the setNumber method of the  address class.But the notification doesn't work without both call wil and didChangeValueForKey.
			
				\section{ Notifications }
						\subsection{M file of the company class}	
							\begin{center}

				\subsection{Raising notification }	
					\begin{center}

						The result in the console.
				
				\section{Conclusion}	
				KVC is very powerful but we have had some problem with the spelling of variable name. And this errors was not detected at the compilation time but at the run time.\\
